        </div>
        <p>I recently participated in the 4-day intensive <span class="highlight">"Bug Jam"</span> competition during my QA engineering bootcamp at TripleTen. My team won first place, outperforming 3 other teams in QA'ing a web app created by software engineering students during July's Code Jam. The competition focused on manual UI testing, where we excelled in test case creation, test coverage, bug logging, and delivering a high-quality visual presentation to the judges.

        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>For this project, I was paired with two awesome teammates, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-dardy/" class="teammate">Jasmine Dardy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-arbaugh/" class="teammate">Noah Arbaugh</a>. Together, we broke down the testing process into manageable steps, diving deep into the STLC. Each of us took charge of different parts of the app, ensuring it was tested from every angle.</p>

    <section class="tools">
        <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
        <p>We used <span class="highlight">Chrome DevTools</span> extensively to analyze performance issues, spot layout inconsistencies across devices, and debug other tricky problems. DevTools became our go-to resource for digging into rendering performance and inspecting elements, which was crucial for diagnosing issues like slow loading times and skewed layouts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="jira">
        <h2>Bug Tracking with Jira</h2>
        <p>We used a shared <span class="highlight">Jira bug tracking template</span> to keep track of all the issues we found. This template allowed us to efficiently log, categorize, and prioritize bugs, making our testing process smoother and more organized.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This experience deepened my understanding of tools like DevTools and the importance of thorough testing. I also sharpened my skills in test planning, bug reporting, crafting effective presentations, and collaboration with a remote team.</p>
        <br><p>The ‚ÄúBug Jam‚Äù was intense but incredibly rewarding. It was a real-world application of everything we've learned so far, and I‚Äôm excited to carry these skills forward in my QA journey.</p>
