    <section class="intro">
        <p>I recently tackled a unique challenge during our QA engineering TripleTen bootcamp—participating in a fast-paced <span class="highlight">"Bug Jam"</span> competition. We had just 4 days to thoroughly QA a web app created by software engineering students during July's Code Jam.</p>

            <h2>Check Out the Website We Tested</h2>
            <p>Explore the <a href="https://summeradventure.netlify.app/" target="_blank" class="tested-website">Summer Adventure</a> website that we thoroughly tested during the Bug Jam.</p>

    <section class="team">
        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>For this project, I was paired with two awesome teammates, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-dardy/" class="teammate">Jasmine Dardy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-arbaugh/" class="teammate">Noah Arbaugh</a>. Together, we broke down the testing process into manageable steps, diving deep into the STLC. Each of us took charge of different parts of the app, ensuring it was tested from every angle.</p>

    <section class="tools">
        <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
        <p>We used <span class="highlight">Chrome DevTools</span> extensively to analyze performance issues, spot layout inconsistencies across devices, and debug other tricky problems. DevTools became our go-to resource for digging into rendering performance and inspecting elements, which was crucial for diagnosing issues like slow loading times and skewed layouts.</p>

    <section class="jira">
        <h2>Bug Tracking with Jira</h2>
        <p>We used a shared <span class="highlight">Jira bug tracking template</span> to keep track of all the issues we found. This template allowed us to efficiently log, categorize, and prioritize bugs, making our testing process smoother and more organized.</p>

    <section class="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This experience deepened my understanding of tools like DevTools and the importance of thorough testing. I also sharpened my skills in test planning, bug reporting, crafting effective presentations, and collaboration with a remote team.</p>
        <br><p>The “Bug Jam” was intense but incredibly rewarding. It was a real-world application of everything we've learned so far, and I’m excited to carry these skills forward in my QA journey.</p>
